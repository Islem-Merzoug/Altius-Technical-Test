This is a simple FastAPI project where I implemented the solution for the exercises, so in order to test from your side, please:
- Clone this project
- Navigate to the root of the project using: cd Altius-Technical-Test
- Activate the Pipenv environment using: pipenv shell
- Run the test_integration.py where we test with sample data delivered and assert the results using: pytest test_integration.py

NB:
- the endpoints are in: main.py
- the structure of the classes are in: linked_list.py
- the test classes are in: test_integration.py

Thanks
